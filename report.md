## Processing
To clean **FitBit Fitness Tracker Data** and  **Fitness Analysis**, It was used _Kate_ and _Excel_, because the first had some problems with the format of the date and hour, so It was changed to a format that Big Query could read, meanwhile, the second dataset was cleaned in _Excel_ 
### Fitness Analysis processing
It was cleaned in a sheet from _Excel_, so we created a control version of the CSV file, and there is documentation about the track changes in the file. To ensure that the information will not be modified the sheet was protected. You can see the document online to see changes and historical versions, [here](https://ugtomx-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/e_lopezlozano_ugto_mx/ESSAp7gCM7dAvdaZZN-UsWwB2d_C9CUcEiWnRLY8fqs95A?e=sWHk9B).  _Review > Track Changes_
