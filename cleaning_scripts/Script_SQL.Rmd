```{sql comprobation of Id column into tables}
SELECT
	table_name,
	SUM(
		CASE
			WHEN 
				column_name = "Id" THEN 1

We create a new datset with calories and steps, to compare this two variables in a day 
```{sql new data calories vs total steps}
SELECT 
  *
FROM 
  `my-project-389422.fitbit_fitness.hourly_calories_merged` AS HC
JOIN
  `my-project-389422.fitbit_fitness.hourly_steps_merged` AS HS
USING
  (Id,ActivityHour,Hour)
```
With this script, we want to measure the METs at the end of the weekend and compare with the recommend METs by week
```{sql new data METs by week}
SELECT
  m.Id,
  CASE
    WHEN
      DATE(m.ActivityMinute) BETWEEN DATE('2016-04-12') AND DATE('2016-04-18') THEN 'Week 1'
    WHEN
      DATE(m.ActivityMinute) BETWEEN DATE('2016-04-19') AND DATE('2016-04-25') THEN 'Week 2'
    WHEN 
      DATE(m.ActivityMinute) BETWEEN DATE('2016-04-26') AND DATE('2016-05-02') THEN 'Week 3'
    WHEN
      DATE(m.ActivityMinute) BETWEEN DATE('2016-05-03') AND DATE('2016-05-09') THEN 'Week 4'
    WHEN
      DATE(m.ActivityMinute) BETWEEN DATE('2016-05-10') AND DATE('2016-05-12') THEN 'Week 5'
    ELSE
      'ERROR'
  END AS week,
  AVG(m.METs) AS mean_METs_weekly
FROM 
  `my-project-389422.fitbit_fitness.minute_METs_narrow_merged` AS m
GROUP BY 
  m.Id, week
ORDER BY
  m.Id
```
In this part, we obtained the average of minutes for activity by individue, so we can observe the main activity between voluntaries.
```{sql new data set average activities by day}
WITH
  sleep AS(
    SELECT  
      SD.Id AS Id, 
      AVG(SD.TotalMinutesAsleep) AS mean_sleeping
    FROM 
      `my-project-389422.fitbit_fitness.sleep_day_merged` AS SD
    GROUP BY 
      Id
  ),
  active AS(
    SELECT
      DI.Id AS Id,  
      AVG(DI.SedentaryMinutes) AS mean_sedentary,
      AVG(DI.LightlyActiveMinutes) AS mean_light_active,
      AVG(DI.FairlyActiveMinutes) AS mean_fairl_active,
      AVG(DI.VeryActiveMinutes) AS mean_very_active
    FROM 
      `my-project-389422.fitbit_fitness.daily_intensities_merged` AS DI
    GROUP BY
      Id
  )
SELECT
  sl.Id, sl.mean_sleeping,
  ac.mean_sedentary, ac.mean_light_active, ac.mean_fairl_active, ac.mean_very_active
FROM
  sleep AS sl
INNER JOIN
  active AS ac
ON
  sl.Id = ac.Id
